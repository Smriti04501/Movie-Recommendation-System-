# Movie-Recommendation-System-

Movie recommendation systems can be created using Natural Language Processing and are mainly of two types: Collaborative filters and Content based filters. 

**This movie recommendation system uses content based filtering to recommend top 10 most similar movies.** Content based filtering uses an algorithm that selects movies based on similarities between them. 

Here, the recommendations are made based on the following attributes of the movies listed in the dataset:
-  Genre in which the movie is listed
-  Description of the movie
